In this article, I'd like you to get hands on with trying to create your own line of best fit and then
working out the loss with the mean squared error.
So what I want you to do is just write down on some paper or on a computer however you like it.
These coordinates where X is one, y is four, x is five, y is eight, x is eight, y is nine, x is
ten, Y is seven.
It doesn't have to be completely accurate in terms of drawing in the right places, but what I want
you to do is then try and draw your own line of best fit that looks like it goes through through them
quite well.
And then I'm going to estimate what the value is for that line at where x is one x is five, x is eight
and x is ten.
And then using that information, I want you to work out the mean squared error.
So essentially work out the loss.
So this would be great experience for you.
So give it a try and then we'll go over the solutions in the next lecture.
