Trước khi đi vào các khái niệm toán học sâu hơn của học sâu (deep learning), tôi muốn cung cấp một cái nhìn tổng quan cao hơn về học sâu thực sự là gì.

Thông qua việc giới thiệu một số ứng dụng thực tế, tôi cũng sẽ mô tả cách nó khác biệt so với học máy (machine learning).

Điểm khác biệt giữa học sâu và học máy
Sử dụng mạng nơ-ron:

Học sâu thường sử dụng mạng nơ-ron (neural networks).
Dù có vẻ phức tạp, nhưng học sâu không phải là điều gì quá khó hiểu như khoa học tên lửa hay phẫu thuật não.
Xử lý các mẫu phức tạp:

Học sâu vượt trội trong việc phát hiện các mẫu phức tạp trong dữ liệu.
Tuy nhiên, khi dữ liệu không có các mẫu phức tạp, học sâu có thể hoạt động kém hiệu quả, vì nó có xu hướng "tìm" ra các mẫu phức tạp không thực sự tồn tại.
Yêu cầu tính toán:

Học sâu yêu cầu lượng tính toán toán học lớn, làm cho nó trở nên tốn kém về mặt tính toán.
Sự phổ biến của học sâu chỉ bắt đầu trong 5-7 năm gần đây, nhờ vào sự phát triển của dữ liệu lớn (big data) và GPU mạnh mẽ.
Tất cả về phát hiện mẫu:

Học sâu và học máy chủ yếu dựa vào việc tìm kiếm các mẫu trong dữ liệu, thay vì đưa ra các quy tắc cứng nhắc.
Ví dụ: nếu có 80% khả năng người đi xe máy gặp tai nạn ở tốc độ 90 dặm/giờ, đó là một mẫu mà học sâu có thể phân tích sâu hơn, bao gồm cả hành vi, tính cách, và tốc độ trung bình của người lái.
Ví dụ thực tế về học sâu
Marketing:

Mạng nơ-ron được sử dụng để dự đoán người dùng nào sẽ có khả năng cao nhấp vào quảng cáo, dựa trên các thông số như tuổi, giới tính, số lượng bạn bè, và thậm chí cả nội dung bài đăng.
Ngân hàng:

Học sâu giúp phát hiện gian lận bằng cách phân tích hành vi của người dùng và phát hiện các mẫu khác biệt với hành vi thông thường.
Y học:

Dự đoán hiệu quả của phương pháp điều trị hoặc tạo ra các loại thuốc mới bằng cách sử dụng mạng nơ-ron để mô phỏng bệnh lý và thử nghiệm các tổ hợp hóa chất.
Dữ liệu và các loại học trong học sâu
Yêu cầu dữ liệu:

Học sâu cần dữ liệu có nhãn (labeled data) để học từ các mẫu trong dữ liệu.
Ví dụ: để dự đoán tai nạn xe máy, cần có dữ liệu về các trường hợp tai nạn và cả những trường hợp không gặp tai nạn.
Ba loại học:

Học có giám sát (Supervised Learning):
Dữ liệu có nhãn và có nhiệm vụ rõ ràng (ví dụ: dự đoán ngôn ngữ từ đoạn văn).
Học không giám sát (Unsupervised Learning):
Chỉ phân tích dữ liệu và tìm kiếm các mẫu hoặc nhóm (ví dụ: phân tích dữ liệu bầu cử).
Học củng cố (Reinforcement Learning):
Dữ liệu được gán nhãn theo "thắng" hoặc "thua," với các quy tắc cụ thể để đạt được mục tiêu (ví dụ: huấn luyện robot di chuyển qua một căn phòng).
Các ví dụ thực hành
Xác định ngôn ngữ:

Đưa đoạn văn và yêu cầu dự đoán ngôn ngữ.
Đây là học có giám sát vì dữ liệu có nhãn (ngôn ngữ) được sử dụng để huấn luyện.
Robot di chuyển:

Huấn luyện robot lần đầu tiên để đi qua một căn phòng.
Đây là học củng cố vì robot phải thử nghiệm nhiều lần để đạt được mục tiêu (thắng).
Phân tích dữ liệu bầu cử:

Xem các mẫu trong dữ liệu bầu cử để phân tích nhóm cử tri.
Đây là học không giám sát vì không có nhiệm vụ hoặc dự đoán cụ thể, chỉ cần tìm ra các mẫu.
Kết luận:

Tự tạo các ví dụ về học có giám sát, không giám sát và học củng cố.
Bạn đã nắm vững các loại học trong học sâu và sẵn sàng cho bài học tiếp theo.



Before we get into some of the deeper mathematical concepts of deep learning, I just wanted to go over

a higher level view of what deep learning actually is.

Through showing you some real world applications, but also describing how it's different to machine

learning.

So just a few points on that.

Deep learning.

We usually apply neural networks, which we'll be going on to very soon, and I think you'll be pleasantly

surprised by actually, it's not the most complicated thing in the world, like rocket science or brain

surgery.

So deep learning is normally superior for trying to uncover more intricate patterns in data.

So it tends to underperform when it's when it's looking at data that doesn't have complex patterns because

it often finds complex patterns that's not there.

So machine learning is actually superior for less complex patterns.

Also, there's a great deal of mathematical calculations that go on during deep learning, so it can

be computationally very expensive.

And that's actually one of the big reasons why deep learning has only just started to get big in the

last, I don't know, five, seven years.

It's because now we're getting access to lots of big data and we have computers now that can handle

all these large mathematical calculations.

So obviously they can both use big data.

So that's just a little point on how it's different to machine learning.

Now, what's really important to grasp at this point on this lecture is that it's all about patterns.

So neural networks, machine learning, all of this.

It's just looking for patterns in data.

It's never it's never going to give us some hard, solid rules, but it's always going to give us some

probabilities.

So I don't know, for example, let's say on a specific road, there's a high accident level for motorbike

motorbike drivers.

And let's say if they go over a certain speed round this round a bend, let's say they go over 90 miles

an hour, then eight out of ten motorbike drivers have a crash.

So there's a 0.8 or an 80% probability that they're going to crash if they're going at that kind of

speed.

That's a very basic pattern.

And if you think about deep learning, it can look at much more intricate patterns.

It might look at things like the speed, of course, but it may look at the behavioural profile of the

person driving the motorbike, it may look at what kind of personality do they have, how fast do they

usually go?

Is it different to how they usually go?

How different?

It basically goes deep, deep into these patterns.

As long as you give it the data, that label data that already gives it information about previous drivers,

it can extract those patterns.

So here's just a few examples.

So, for example, in marketing, neural networks can be used in a number of different ways.

They're actually used quite often when deciding, when deciding who to where, who, which individuals

to give an ad to.

So let's say on Facebook, then certain marketing companies will have neural networks that are able

to predict which users are going to be most likely to click on an ad, And the way they do that is by

giving their neural network the parameters like their age, their sex, their number of friends, you

know, and with this whole Cambridge Analytica thing, for example, they could actually look at the

profiles of their friends as well.

And so so it goes very deep into the personal profile, maybe even their posts and keywords in those

posts.

So that's just one way of looking of how deep neural networks have been used for marketing.

It's used a lot in fraud.

So banks are actually able to look at the behavior of an individual and or an individual account, let's

say.

And if the behavior is different to how it may be for for the the person who owns the account, then

it may be flagged up as fraud because it's actually neural networks are actually able to detect patterns

in behavior.

So in medicine it's also used quite frequently now.

So it's used not only to predict how how successful a treatment might be for an individual based on

the individual profile and the medicine itself.

It's even being used to create new medicines.

And that's absolutely incredible.

So it's we're now at the stage where neural networks are able to come up with new combinations to try

and create new medicines, and then they're able to create other neural networks that are able to simulate

a person's disease.

And so they're able to almost create use a neural network to both create and to shape a new medicines.

So it's all very exciting.

So it's all about learning.

So the really important thing that neural networks need is, of course, data.

We can't just give it a task and then, you know, to to, for example, I don't know, predict whether

whether a motorcyclist is going to fall off their bike or not if they don't have any data on on previous

motorcyclists you have and haven't fallen off their their bikes before.

So not only do they need to have some kind of data to go with, but they also need a direction to be

given.

So for example, if we're creating an image classifier where it's able to say if there's a dog in an

image, well then we need to give the the, the neural network a bunch of images of dogs so it knows

what to look for.

So there are three main types of learning and we've pretty much solely focused on supervised learning

for now.

Up until now.

And we'll also be looking at looking at supervised learning for the the main part of the neural networks

because it's one of the most commonly used and applied.

So with supervised, it's basically that you have labeled data and a task.

So with Titanic, for example, the labeled data was data of people who either had who either survived

or didn't survive when the Titanic crashed.

And and we and we were given a lot of information on each of those individuals.

So if we're talking about some of the applications before so for example, with the with the motorbike

accidents, then what's important there is that we're provided with information of previous accidents.

And also it's also helpful to have information on on the driver's motorbike drivers who didn't have

accidents as well.

So that's what our labeled data is.

And it also needs to be given a task, right?

So it needs to be told to find out, to be able to predict whether someone has an accident or not,

or to identify a dog in a bit in an image or something like that.

So it needs to have some kind of task.

Now, unsupervised learning is different.

It doesn't actually need to have a task.

It's just given a lot of labeled data and it's being asked to show clustering.

So it's it's basically not not being asked to make predictions or anything like that, but it's able

to look at data and show patterns to us.

So in reinforcement learning, it's slightly different.

But we have labeled data again and we and we give the the program sort of some rules and a win lose

situation.

So one example might be if you create a robot and the rules are you can move your arms up, down, left

and right and you can open and close your hand and the task is to pick up a cup and move it to its right.

But it's not.

It has to.

It's never experienced the world before, so it has to try moving left, right up, down so as to try

lots of times and each time it doesn't manage to pick up the cup and move it to the right.

That means it's lost.

So it's going to keep trying until it wins.

And so that's reinforcement learning where it's just trying to trying to win in a certain situation

where it's given and it's given some rules in order to get there.

So we're just going to do a few practice examples now just to test whether you understand what supervised,

unsupervised and reinforcement learning is.

So don't worry if you're not completely sure, give it a try because it's just very helpful at this

point just to get your brain working and get thinking.

So I'm going to give you an example here of language identification.

Let's say we're creating a website where the user can put in, I don't know, a paragraph of text in

whatever language they want, and then we're able to output what language it is.

So we would need to train a neural network.

We need to give it lots of data that already contain these languages and tell it which language is which.

So then it's then able to make predictions when it's provided with new data.

So do you think that might be supervised, unsupervised or reinforcement learning?

Pause the video now.

Have a think and have a guess.

So this one is supervised learning simply because as we look back here, we've been given we're giving

the neural network labeled data.

So we're saying whether or which language it is.

So we're giving it some data, like the actual text, and then we're giving the name of the language.

So it's being labeled, and then we're giving it the task of being able to predict whether or not it's

French, Spanish, etcetera.

So let's look at another example.

So robotics with movement, let's say we create a robot and we want it to be able to walk across a room

and this is the first time it's ever moved before.

But it does know that the rules are it can move it.

These things called legs up and down, forwards and backwards, left and right.

And it's allowed as many goals as it wants.

But the task is to walk across the room.

So pause the video.

Now, have a think whether that's supervised, unsupervised or reinforcement learning.

So this one is reinforcement learning.

That's because it's been given labeled data as win or lose.

So win is to walk across the room.

To lose is to not not manage that the rules are that it can move its legs in certain ways.

Another example of reinforcement learning that's quite popular is that we actually train a computer

to play computer games.

So, for example, Mortal Kombat or Street Fighter is quite a popular example where you have a street

fighter game and the computer is given the rules that it can jump, move left and right, and it has

these four attack buttons and that's all it's given.

And the win the win is to win a fight.

To lose is to lose a fight.

And you just let the game play over and over and over against, well, the computer until it gets really

good.

Finally voting records.

So let's say we want to see we have the data for some voting records and we want to see patterns in

that data.

So we want to see what demographics are voting for a specific party.

So that one is unsupervised learning because essentially we just we're just providing it with lots of

data and we just want to see patterns.

We don't want any predictions.

We don't want it to do any kind of win or lose thing.

We literally just want to see what patterns are in this data.

We want to see what demographics are voting for which which candidate.

So that's unsupervised learning.

So that's it for this lecture.

So have a have a go yourself.

Try and create some examples of supervised, unsupervised and reinforcement learning for yourself.

And then essentially you already know the different types of deep learning.

So you're ready.

You'll be ready for the next lecture.
