    <h1> Flowers shine like the sun </h1>
    <p>Sunflower is a soft-stemmed plant, weighing only about one meter tall. And the leaves look very big like elephant ears fluttering to catch the sun and wind. Flower leaves are usually green and usually towards the end of the plant the leaves become darker green, on the edge of the leaves there are serrations as if to protect their beautiful flowers.</p>
